                <h3><em>Rene Azcuy</em></h3>

            <p>Azcuy jump started a very characteristic style that was recognized in Cuban cinema</p>
            <p>Azcuy was also known for his use of color restriction and juxtaposition to convey clearer 
            messages through his design which ensured that his audience did not get lost in the message 
            that he was trying to convey through his work.</p>

                <h3><em>Tinashe</em></h3>
            
            </a>

            <img src="img/tinashe 2.png" alt="Tinashe Discography">
            <p>Tinashe wrote, produced, and engineered her mixtapes, and released them to the world via 
            YouTube. It was after her fourth self-produced mixtape that got her signed to a major record 
            deal. What I appreciate about her is that she is that she will always step out of the “box” 
            and try new artistic approaches with her image, sound, and visuals, making her image nothing 
            but her own.</p>

                <h3>Dorethea Lange</h3>
                
            </a>

            <img src="img/dLange1 2.png" alt="Dorthea Lange's photography 4">
            <p>Lange's work is so meaningful because she could capture photos of her subjects at their
            most challenging moment, face the cards that life has given them, and capture their beauty. 
            Her photography showcased the horrific consequences of the Great Depression, which became 
            a symbol and promoted a national plan to restore prosperity and prevent further depression.</h4>
            </p>We can see through her lensed the harsh reality the world has endured because of Dorothea 
            Lange. Dorothy’s work is relevant to me as well as everyone else because it’s because of her 
            that we can see the tragedies and injustice that many people faced before us</h4>
